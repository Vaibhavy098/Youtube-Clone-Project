# Youtube-Clone-Project
This is a simple clone of YouTube's front-end design created using HTML and CSS. The project replicates the basic layout and styling of YouTube, focusing on a clean user interface without any backend functionality.

This project is a front-end clone of YouTube, built to practice and improve my skills in HTML and CSS. The clone aims to closely resemble the UI of YouTube, including navigation, video thumbnails, and a video player section. It does not include any functionality for playing videos or interacting with an actual backend.
